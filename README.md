<h2> About Me </h2>
I am a results-driven machine learning specialist with a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence and extensive experience in both academia and the industry, including working with and consulting for various start-ups. Over the years, I have tackled a wide variety of machine learning projects, from inception to deployment, demonstrating my adaptability and commitment to delivering high-quality solutions. My hands-on expertise in building and training numerous models is complemented by my proficiency in using cloud service providers like AWS to efficiently execute and scale projects. With a solid foundation in AI, ML, and deep learning, honed through plus 10 years of teaching at the university level, I am well-equipped to contribute significantly to any organization and drive innovation in the rapidly-evolving field of machine learning.

- 🚀 I'm the Chief Technology Wizard 🧙‍♂️ at MarginsAI, dabbling in the mystical arts of AI and startup alchemy at the ADAPT Centre, TCD, Dublin.
- 🌱 By day, I'm a Machine Learning Engineer, conjuring up models that learn like humans (but without the need for coffee! ☕). From building and training to testing and deploying, I make sure these digital brains are top-notch!
- 👯‍♂️ On the lookout for fellow adventurers! Eager to team up on new startup quests and innovative escapades. Have an idea? Let's make it the next big thing together!
- 💬 Wizard's hat off, I'm all ears for chit-chats about Python spells, programming puzzles, AI enigmas, ML mysteries, and DL dilemmas. Got questions? I've got answers (or at least, I'll Google them really fast 😉).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once tried to use a neural network to predict tomorrow's weather. Ended up with a model that's convinced it's always "raining cats and dogs"! 🐱🌧️🐶

<h2> Magical Toolkit </h2>
